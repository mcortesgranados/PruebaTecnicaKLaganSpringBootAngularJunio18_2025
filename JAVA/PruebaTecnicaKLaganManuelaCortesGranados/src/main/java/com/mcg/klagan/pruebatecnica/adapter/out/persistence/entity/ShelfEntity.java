/**
 * ShelfEntity represents the JPA-mapped database entity for a shelf.
 *
 * üì¶ Layer: Adapter ‚Üí Outbound ‚Üí Persistence
 * üß± Role in Hexagonal Architecture:
 *      - This class is part of the infrastructure layer.
 *      - It serves as the bridge between the domain model (pure Java) and the relational database (H2).
 *      - It persists data from the domain model into the database without polluting the domain with framework concerns.
 *
 * üìê SOLID Principles Applied:
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚úÖ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
 *      - This class has only one reason to change: changes in the database mapping of a Shelf.
 *      - It does not contain business logic (which belongs in the domain layer).
 *
 * ‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
 *      - Closed for modification: JPA mappings remain stable.
 *      - Open for extension: New mapping annotations or fields can be added without altering the core logic.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
 *      - Respected by relying only on standard types (e.g., enums, Long, associations).
 *
 * ‚úÖ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) & Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
 *      - Not directly applicable at the entity level but respected overall by separating persistence from domain via mappers.
