/**
 * WarehouseFamily is a domain enum that defines the category (family) of a warehouse.
 *
 * üéØ Purpose in Domain-Driven Design (DDD):
 *      - Encapsulates a business rule: defines which shelf types are allowed per family.
 *      - Adds behavior to what would otherwise be a simple constant enum.
 *      - Represents a domain concept clearly and unambiguously.
 *
 * üß± Role in Hexagonal Architecture:
 *      - This enum belongs to the domain model, the innermost and purest layer.
 *      - It contains no technical or infrastructural dependencies.
 *      - It is used by application services, use cases, and also mapped from/to persistence adapters.
 *
 * üìê SOLID Principles Applied:
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚úÖ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
 *      - This enum has a single responsibility: define and expose allowed shelf types per family.
 *      - It contains no unrelated logic or infrastructure concerns.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
 *      - New families can be added by adding new enum constants (open for extension).
 *      - Existing logic remains untouched (closed for modification).
 *
 * ‚úÖ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
 *      - Each enum constant can be substituted as a valid `WarehouseFamily` with predictable behavior.
 *
 * ‚ùå Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Not applicable for enums.
 * ‚ùå Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Not applicable directly, but respected in layered architecture.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Immutability:
 *      - EnumSet is immutable from the outside via encapsulation.
 *      - Promotes thread safety and reliable behavior in business logic.
 *
 * Usage example:
 *   - `WarehouseFamily.EST.getAllowedTypes()` returns `[A, B, C]`.
 *   - Used during shelf validation and permutation calculations.
