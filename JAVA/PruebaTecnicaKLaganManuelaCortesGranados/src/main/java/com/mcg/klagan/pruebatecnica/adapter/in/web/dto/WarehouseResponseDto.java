/**
 * WarehouseResponseDto is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) used to represent warehouse data
 * sent back to the client as part of a REST response.
 *
 * üì¶ Layer: Adapter ‚Üí Inbound ‚Üí Web (DTO)
 * üß± Role in Hexagonal Architecture:
 *      - Acts as an output model from the web adapter to the external world (e.g., REST clients).
 *      - Isolates the domain model from serialization details and response formatting.
 *
 * üßº Clean Architecture Role:
 *      - Part of the "Interface Adapters" layer.
 *      - Serves as the response format to decouple external interfaces from domain entities.
 *      - Populated from the domain model using a `WarehouseMapper` to prevent leaking domain internals.
 *
 * üìê Domain-Driven Design (DDD):
 *      - This DTO does not contain business logic, only represents the data view needed by clients.
 *      - Translates from domain aggregates (Warehouse, Shelf) into a simplified, flattened format.
 *      - References domain enum `WarehouseFamily`, which preserves semantic meaning.
 *
 * üìê SOLID Principles:
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚úÖ SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):
 *      - This class only encapsulates response data for a warehouse resource.
 *      - Nested `ShelfDto` only holds shelf response data.
 *
 * ‚úÖ OCP (Open/Closed Principle):
 *      - Easily extendable (e.g., you can add more fields like `createdAt`, `status`) without modifying other layers.
 *
 * ‚úÖ LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle):
 *      - The response DTO behaves consistently for all consumers of REST API output.
 *
 * ‚ùå ISP and ‚ùå DIP: Not directly applicable to DTOs.
 *
 * üß™ Usage:
 *      - Returned in controller methods such as `GET /warehouses/{id}` or `POST /warehouses`.
 *      - Built from domain models through a `WarehouseMapper` or service layer transformation.
