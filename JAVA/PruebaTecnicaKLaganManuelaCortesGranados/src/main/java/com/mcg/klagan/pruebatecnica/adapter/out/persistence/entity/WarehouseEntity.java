/**
 * WarehouseEntity represents the JPA entity that maps a warehouse to the "warehouses" table.
 *
 * üì¶ Layer: Adapter ‚Üí Outbound ‚Üí Persistence
 * üß± Role in Hexagonal Architecture:
 *      - Acts as an infrastructure detail responsible for persistence.
 *      - Implements the output port requirement to store and retrieve `Warehouse` objects.
 *      - Keeps the domain model clean and free from persistence annotations.
 *
 * üìê SOLID Principles Applied:
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚úÖ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
 *      - Has a single responsibility: define the structure and mapping of a warehouse in the database.
 *      - It does not contain any business logic.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
 *      - Can be extended with new fields or annotations without modifying the domain logic.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
 *      - Used via interfaces and mapping (not inheritance here, but composition complies).
 *
 * ‚úÖ Interface Segregation & Dependency Inversion (ISP/DIP):
 *      - Applied at the architectural level through use of `WarehouseRepositoryPort` and mappers.
 *
 * üîÑ Mapping Consideration:
 *      - Bidirectional relation with `ShelfEntity` for full access to shelves per warehouse.
 *      - Cascade and orphanRemoval ensures child records are managed with parent lifecycle.
 *
 * üíæ Persistence:
 *      - JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Id`, `@OneToMany`) handle table mappings.
 *      - Enum `WarehouseFamily` is stored as a string to keep database readability.
 *
 * üìå Used with:
 *      - `WarehouseMapper` to convert between `WarehouseEntity` and domain `Warehouse`.
 *      - `SpringWarehouseRepository` (extends `JpaRepository`) for DB operations.
